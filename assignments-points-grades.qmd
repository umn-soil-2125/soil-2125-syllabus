# Assignments, Points, and Grading

## Assignments and Points (753 points)[^1]

### **Lecture Questions (60 points, 9% of your grade)**

Every lecture will have at least one question which is used for attendance and participation purposes, i.e. you don't need to answer the question correctly to get full points. However, the questions also serve as review. Lecture questions are answered through Socrative or by paper in lecture. There is no make- up work for lecture questions! (30 lectures X 2 points = 60 points).

### **Weekly Quiz (Two Parts) (280 points, 37% of your grade)**

You will be required to complete a weekly quiz on Canvas in two parts. The quiz will cover material from the lecture mini-videos/lecture slides and other companion materials. There are two parts to the quiz each week: Part I is due on Wednesdays by 11:59PM - it will ensure you are prepped for discussion, and Part II is due on Fridays by 11:59PM. Part I is worth 5 points, and Part II is worth 15 points for a total of 20 points per week. All materials will be posted 1 week in advance and you are free to complete the quizzes any time before the due days. (14 quizzes x 20 points = 280 points).

### **Discussion Team Collaborations (84 points, 11% of your grade)**

During our Thursday discussion sessions, you will be collaborating in small groups (3-4 students) to complete a team exercise that is closely related to the weekly quiz and lecture topics for the week. You will get points for correctly completing a collaborative assignment as a group. (14 discussions x 6 points = 70 points).

### **Lab Assignment and Quizzes (104 points, 14% of your grade)**

Each weekly lab will require students to complete a laboratory exercise sheet and lab quiz. The quiz will be taken after the lab TA has checked the lab assignment sheet. The lab assignment sheet is worth 3 points and the quiz is worth 3 points. Make sure to sign in and out of lab. (13 labs X 6 points = 78 points).

### **Land-use Report (85 points, 11% of your grade)**

One of the main goals in this course is for you to walk away knowing how to obtain, use, understand and interpret information from soil surveys. This is an important skill that will set you apart in the workforce from people who don't know how to do this. To support this course objective, you will be required to produce a brief (2 p.), professional-style report (with a cover letter) on appropriate land-uses for a client based on information from a soil survey.

### **Exams (200 points, 27% of your grade)**

There will be four unit exams (the "final" will be a Unit 4 exam). Unit exams will include material from that unit's lectures and labs (50 points each). Note: Exams will be open on Canvas for a minimum of 36 hours - you will be able to take the exams at any time during the open period, but they must be completed when the period closes.

## Grading

### Evaluation

Final course grades use the +/- system of grading. Course grades will be assigned using the following scale, which is based on the UMN [Grading and Transcripts Policy](https://policy.umn.edu/education/gradingtranscripts):

| **Letter Grade** | **Percent** |
|------------------|-------------|
| A                | \> 93       |
| A-               | 90 to \< 93 |
| B+               | 87 to \< 90 |
| B                | 83 to \< 87 |
| B-               | 80 to \< 83 |
| C+               | 77 to \<80  |
| C                | 73 to \< 77 |
| C-               | 70 to \< 73 |
| D+               | 67 to \< 70 |
| D                | 60 to \< 67 |
| F                | \< 60       |

### Grade Assignments

Grades will be assigned by earned point values as described on this page. No curve will be applied. **I do not oblige requests for grade "bump-ups" for extra credit at the end off the semester as these requests are not fair to your fellow students and against University policy. However, I do calculate everybody's final grade with a 0.5% grace (after giving you the 6 points back). So, in other words, if you are within 0.5% of the next grade category you will receive the higher grade. Be proud of the grade you earned!**

### Grading Challenges

Any challenges to graded assignments you wish to be considered should be emailed to the TA within one week of the posting date of the graded item.
