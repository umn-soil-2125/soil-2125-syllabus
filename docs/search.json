    "text": "Whether you know it or not, at some point in your life you have studied soil. Many of you studied soils as children; digging holes, hunting for nightcrawlers, making sandcastles, or painting faces with mud. Others of you grew up working on farms or planting gardens. Whatever your background, you come into this class already knowing at least a few things about what soil looks like, feels like and smells like.\nMany people have only had the chance to interact with the top six inches of soil and think all soil looks the same. In reality, soils are highly diverse and once you know a little bit about soils and their diversity, it is difficult to find a “boring” place on earth ever again. In this class, we approach soil as a natural system worthy of study in its own right. Because complex biological, chemical and physical processes affect the way soils form and the way that they are managed, we will use first principles from biology, chemistry and physics to understand them.\nFrancis Hole, a famous soil scientist, was well known for saying that all humans are TNS, or “Temporarily Not Soil”. The atomic building blocks for most of our body mass came from or were supported by soil through the plants or animals that we eat, and when we die those building blocks will return to the soil. So, in a very real sense, we are all made up of soil and our lives, communities, and cultures depend on our understanding of it."

Part I contains handouts - this is also provided as a pdf on the course website. Part II of the course packet is a bound lab manual. You MUST have your lab manual with you when you come to do the self-paced lab.\nTextbook (Recommended Only) No textbook is required for this course. However, if you need a reference or if you are planning on continuing your work with and study of soils in the future, I recommend the text, which is available from most online booksellers. There are two versions of the recommended text, and many editions. The full version (more than 1,000 pages) is called The Nature and Properties of Soils by Ray Weil and Nyle Brady and is on its 15th Edition (2016 for hardcover/2022 for paperback). The abridged version is called Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils also by Ray Weil and Nyle Brady and is on its 4th Edition (2018). Note that the 15th edition of the full text and the 4th edition of the abridged text are the newest, but the previous 14th (full version) and 3rd (abridged version) editions work just as well and are generally much cheaper to purchase from online book sellers. The course schedule has recommended readings from the 3rd edition of Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils or the 14th Edition (paperback) of The Nature and Properties of Soils:\n\nElements of the Nature and Properties of Soils (6th Ed.), Brady and Weil\n\nOR\n\nThe Nature and Properties of Soils (15th Ed.), Brady and Weil\n\nCourse Website: Lecture notes and other course materials will be available on the class website through Canvas.

During a typical week, you will have a Pre-Discussion Quiz due on Canvas by Wednesday at 11:59PM, a live discussion session in 174 Plant Growth Facilities on Thursdays, and a Weekly Summary Quiz due by Friday at 11:59PM.\nYou will complete the lab at a time of your choosing between Wednesday and Friday each week. You’ll sign up for a lab timeslot during the first week of class. We hope that this helps structure your schedule and your interaction with the asynchronous lecture materials.\nCourse materials will be posted at least one week in advance, so you are free to work on a schedule that works best for you. If you engage with all of the lecture and lecture companion materials, attend discussion sections and lab at your chosen time, you will be very familiar with the material and won’t have a problem on the exams.\nCome to discussion prepared to participate! Unit summaries, review sessions, and additional materials on the Canvas site will help you study as well. We really look forward to meeting and working with you.\nYou are encouraged to ask any and all questions - even the “stupid” ones! (P.S. There are no stupid questions ;)."

    "text": "Lecture Questions (50 points, 6% of your grade)\nEvery lecture will have live polls (through Poll Everywhere) that contain at least one question which is used for attendance and participation purposes, i.e. you don’t need to answer the question correctly to get full points. However, the questions will also serve as review. Lecture questions are answered through Poll Everywhere or by paper (in case your phone is not working correctly) in lecture. There are 29 lectures throughout the semester and you will get full credit for attending 25 of them. Attending additional lectures beyond the 25 required will count as extra credit points. There is no make- up work for lecture questions! (25 lectures X 2 points = 50 points).\nPre-Discussion Quiz (70 points, 9% of your grade)\nYou will be required to complete a weekly pre-discussion quiz on Canvas. The quiz will cover material from the lecture and lecture companion materials on Canvas. The pre-discussion quiz will ensure you are prepped for small group and active learning activities in discussion. Pre-discussion quizzes are worth 5 points each and are due on Wednesdays by 11:59PM. All materials will be posted 1 week in advance and you are free to complete the quizzes any time before the due dates. (14 quizzes x 5 points = 70 points).\nWeekly Summary Quiz (225 points, 28% of your grade)\nThe weekly summary quiz will cover material from lecture, lecture companion materials, lab, and discussion. Each weekly summary quiz is worth 15 points and is due on Fridays by 11:59PM. All materials will be posted 1 week in advance and you are free to complete the quizzes any time before the due days. (15 quizzes x 15 points = 225 points).\nDiscussion Team Exercises (84 points, 11% of your grade)\nDuring our Thursday discussion sessions, you will be collaborating in small groups (3-4 students) to complete a team exercise that is closely related to the weekly quiz and lecture topics for the week. You will get points for correctly completing a collaborative assignment as a group. (14 discussions x 6 points = 84 points).\nLab Assignment and Quizzes (78 points, 10% of your grade)\nEach weekly lab will require students to complete a laboratory exercise sheet and lab quiz. The quiz will be taken after the lab TA has checked the lab assignment sheet. The lab assignment sheet is worth 3 points and the quiz is worth 3 points. Make sure to sign in and out of lab. (13 labs X 6 points = 78 points).\nLand-use Report (87 points, 11% of your grade)\nOne of the main goals in this course is for you to walk away knowing how to obtain, use, understand and interpret information from soil surveys. This is an important skill that will set you apart in the workforce from people who don’t know how to do this. To support this course objective, you will be required to produce a brief (2 p.), professional-style report (with a cover letter) on appropriate land-uses for a client based on information from a soil survey.\nExams (200 points, 25% of your grade)\nThere will be four unit exams (the “final” will be a Unit 4 exam). Unit exams will include material from that unit’s lectures and labs (50 points each). Note: Exams will be open on Canvas for a minimum of 36 hours - you will be able to take the exams at any time during the open period, but they must be completed when the period closes."

No curve will be applied. I do not oblige requests for grade “bump-ups” for extra credit at the end off the semester as these requests are not fair to your fellow students and against University policy. However, I do calculate everybody’s final grade with a 0.5% grace (after giving you the 6 points back). So, in other words, if you are within 0.5% of the next grade category you will receive the higher grade.

Scholastic dishonesty means plagiarizing; cheating on assignments or examinations; engaging in unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; submitting false or incomplete records of academic achievement; acting alone or in cooperation with another to falsify records or to obtain dishonestly grades, honors, awards, or professional endorsement; altering, forging, or misusing a University academic record; or fabricating or falsifying data, research procedures, or data analysis. (see Student Conduct Code: link on page 4 of this syllabus). If it is determined that a student has cheated, he or she may be given an “F” or an “N” for the course, and may face additional sanctions from the University.\nThe Office for Community Standards provides a wealth of information on the Student Conduct Code and Scholastic Dishonesty. If you have additional questions, please clarify with your instructor for the course. Your instructor can respond to your specific questions regarding what would constitute scholastic dishonesty in the context of a particular class-e.g., whether collaboration on assignments is permitted, requirements and methods for citing sources, if electronic aids are permitted or prohibited during an exam."
